LinkedList are dynamic data structure and memory is allocated at run time.
The concept of linked list is not to store data contiguously, use the links that point to the next elements.

Performance wise linked lists are slower than arrays beacuse there is no direct access to linked list elements.
The linked list is a useful datastructure when we don't know the number of elements to be stored a head of time.
