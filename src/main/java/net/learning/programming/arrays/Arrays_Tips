ArrayList : An ArrayList or dynamically Programming array. is an array that resizes itself as needed while still providing O(1)
A typical implementation is that when the array is full, the array doubles in sizes. Each doubling takes O(n) time, but happens
so rarely that its amortized time is still O(1).

Array: Once the size is defined you cannot resize the array.
